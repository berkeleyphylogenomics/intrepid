                            The function of a protein is largely a result of
                            its primary sequence, but not all positions in the protein
                            sequence are equally important for determining function. Some
                            positions are absolutely critical for protein function, while
                            others are less important.

                            Evolutionary theory suggests that functionally critical 
                            residues should be highly conserved across all members of
                            a protein family. Residues responsible for functional
                            differences in protein subfamilies may have more restricted     
                            distributions of evolutionary conservation.

                            Our INTREPID algorithm 
                            (<a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/21/2445" target="_blank">Sankararaman and Sj&ouml;lander, Bioinformatics 2008</a>)   
                            exploits patterns of evolutionary conservation across a
                            protein family phylogeny to infer functionally critical
                            residues for a query sequence.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The INTREPID server has been designed to be easy to use: 
                            paste a standard FASTA-formatted protein query sequence 
                            in the text box, then click the "Submit" button.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Although easy to use, the INTREPID server performs a number
                            of complex analyses, including retrieving homologous proteins,
                            constructing a multiple sequence alignment, inferring a 
                            protein family phylogeny, building a comparative 3D structural
                            model of the query sequence, and identifying evolutionarily
                            conserved residues.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Due to the computational complexity of these analyses, 
                            results may not be available for an hour or more. In the
                            case of extremely large protein families with thousands of
                            highly divergent homologs, analyses can take a few hours to
                            complete.

                            After submitting your sequence for analysis, a URL link
                            will be provided, which will allow you to check the progress
                            of your analysis at a later time. You may also provide your
                            email address, in which case an email will be sent to you when
                            your results are ready.
