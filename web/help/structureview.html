    We plot the INTREPID evolutionary conservation scores on a 3D structure
    of the query sequence. If the query sequence has a solved structure in
    the Protein Data Bank (PDB), that structure is used. If not, a structural
    model is constructed using the MODELLER software.
    </p>
    <p class="bpg_text">
    The structure is displayed using the Jmol applet, which allows you to
    interactively manipulate the display.
    </p>
    <p class="bpg_text">
    The structure display uses a conservation score cutoff to define 
    significantly conserved residues. Residues with a score at least
    as large as the cutoff are highlighted in blue. Other residues
    are colored white.
    </p>
    <p class="bpg_text">
    You can change the conservation score cutoff by moving the horizontal
    slider below the structure display. Sliding the bar
    will change the cutoff value; releasing the bar will cause the page
    to refresh using the new cutoff value.
