    We plot the INTREPID evolutionary conservation scores against the
    query sequence. Hovering over either the residue or the bar graph
    will display the residue code, sequence position, and conservation
    score for the selected residue.
    </p>
    <p class="bpg_text">
    The sequence display uses a conservation score cutoff to define
    significantly conserved residues. Residues with a score at least
    as large as the cutoff are highlighted in blue. The scores of
    other residues are colored grey.
    </p>
    <p class="bpg_text">
    You can change the conservation score cutoff by moving the
    horizontal slider to the left of the sequence display. If a
    3D structure is shown, the slider is below the structure
    display. Sliding the bar will change the cutoff value; releasing
    the bar will cause the page to refresh using the new cutoff
    value.
