At the time of this check-in, this directory has two disjointed types of files.
The intrepid.py file which was an initial port to run intrepid on Ohana. It is
unknown if that was finished. Additional svn logs against intrepid.p should
shed more light on the situation.

The second file is the quick script used to run intrepid on manuscripts. This
is an initial port of the command line pipeline so that we can run intrepid on
different given manuscripts. This script assumes that you first change
directory to the manuscript before the command is executed.
